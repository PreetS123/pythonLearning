# Q1: Write a program that asks the user for 3 sentences and saves them to a file called sentences.txt.

# Approach I :

# for i in range(1, 4):
#     sentence = input(f"Enter {i} sentence: ")
#     with open("sentence.txt", "a") as f:
#         f.write(sentence,"\n")

# Approach II:
# with open("sentence.txt", 'a') as f:
#     for i in range(1, 4):
#         sentence = input(f"Enter sentence {i}: ")
#         f.write(sentence + "\n")

# with open("sentence.txt", "r") as f:
#     lines = f.readlines()
#     print("Number of lines: ", len(lines))
